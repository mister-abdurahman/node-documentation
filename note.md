# What is NodeJS & why use it?

node is a javascript runtime built on the v8 engine that makes it possible for us to run javascript outside of the browser.

# Some things we can now do with javascript on the node environment that we couldnt do on th ebrowser are : accesing the file system, better networking capabilities, all these advantages spice up a perfect condition for using node as a web server i.e using javascript on the server-side of web development.

repl stands for read.eval.print.loop

use "node" to enter the node repl and ".exit" or "ctrl+D" to exit the repl.
hit "tab" when in the node repl to see all the global variables available on node or to see all global variables on a particular variable like string, do "string.(hit tab)"

# Blocking & Non bloking asynchronous nature of Nodejs

Synchronous code = blocking code üëé (Node is single threaded)
Asynchronous code = non-blocking code üëç

A solution to callback hell is using Promises or async/await.

http module gives us networking capabilities

"\_\_dirname" is used to signify where the file that runs the script is running from.

# the api only understands json so we send data in json format to the api and when we recieve data we need to parse it for javscript to understand it.

In NodeJS, every file is treated as a module.
"module.exports" to export from a module.

# NPM

NPM is a software we use to manage all the 3rd party libarires we decide to use in our project
